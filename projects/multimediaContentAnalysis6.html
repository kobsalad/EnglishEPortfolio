            <p id="caption">Meme titled "Internet Argument" from <a href="https://xkcd.com/438/">xkcd.com</a>. Published 6/18/2008 by Randall Munroe.</p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                This meme is from <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd.com</a>, which is a website full
                of memes and comics. They all share a somewhat academic theme, and a similar art style.
                These memes may not be as funny as others, but I figured that memes from this website
                would have the most meaning.
            </p>
            <h3>Rhetorical Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                This comic took me a while to understand when I first saw it. I tried to skim through
                it but I got confused. Compared to most other comics, this one has many cells. I think that this
                organizational structure is a rhetorical strategy. It adds a sense of fluidity to the comic,
                almost like an animation. This also forces the reader to carefully look through each cell in order.
                By having many segments, this comic structure reminds me of other chart style memes from xkcd.
                An example of this is the fruit chart shown below.
                Another rhetorical strategy used here is pathos because the comic
                conveys an emotion of pointlessness. The lack of spoken words is responsible for this
                emotion, combined with the lack of conflict after the two arguers meet. Since the two
                arguers did not choose physical conflict, their argument did not
                matter as much as it once seemed.

            <h3>Power Dynamics</h3>
            <p>
                Internet arguments are currently common in society. This comic challenges societal norms surrounding the importance
                of arguments. It conveys the idea that arguments may not always be important, and they
                should not involve angry conflict. Within this comic, there is a godly figure that
                brings these two arguers together. This figure has much more power over the other two,
                and they are trying to use their powers to teach a lesson.
            </p>
            <h3>Considering Different Perspectives</h3>
            <p>
                Since this comic was created in 2008, there may be differences in how it was interpreted
                back then versus now. The internet was likely much more anonymous, as
                people had less of a digital footprint. This could encourage more arguments. On the
                contrary, I also think there could be reasons for people to argue less on the internet
                during that time. People could have had more respect for the internet
                because it was new, encouraging them to act kindly. There is also
                the possibility that a viewer of this comic is unfamiliar with technology and
                unable to relate to internet arguments.
