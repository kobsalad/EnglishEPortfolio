            <h3>Memes and Rhetorical Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout this week's activity, I was able to analyze some abstract rhetorical strategies.
                I spoke about the organizational structure of my chosen meme, and this is abstract because
                it is not a commonly thought of rhetorical strategy. I also spoke about pathos, which is
                a much more popular strategy. I believe that a rhetorical strategy is a very broad term,
                and there are many things that can be considered rhetorical strategies. This applies to
                concepts that have never been thought of before. I think my perception of memes has changed
                as I have realized that some memes can have true meaning pulled from them. These meaningful
                memes might not be very funny, but they can convey a message. In comparison, there are
                memes that are purely meant to be funny, and viewers will typically not get any message
                from these types of memes. It's difficult to pick a favorite meme but a video of a dog
                eating a tomato comes to mind. I like it because it is cute and goofy. It is shown below.

            <h3>The Revision Process</h3>
            <p>
                I did receive one piece of negative feedback from my partner. Since I included two memes
                in my assignment, she became confused by the second meme because she didn't know if it
                was being analyzed. I think this confusion is caused because people tend to look at images
                before reading the text on a page. I tried to use the second meme to support another point
                I was making, and I explained this in the text. I also wrote a caption for the meme saying
                that it was not part of the analysis. Next time I still would like to include 2 or more
                images in my analysis to make it more multimodal, but I will try to be more clear about
                why it is being included. When reviewing my partner's meme, I was familiar with the
                general format of the meme. It was a common image with text. The meme was about how
                students become shy when they have to present in class. I can relate to this because I
                become somewhat nervous before presenting, but I think my presentation skills are still
                above average.
