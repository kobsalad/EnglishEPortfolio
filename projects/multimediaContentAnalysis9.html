            <h2>A Reading Resurgence</h2>

            <h3>When Did I Read It?</h3>
            <p>
                As of writing this analysis, I read the book 10 days ago, which was on 11/3/2024. I was 18 years old which is still my current age. When most people think of influential books, they would likely think back to books they read years ago. I have read some fun books as a child, but these didn't stand out to me. I had taken a long break from reading up until now. How could I argue that my childhood books were influential if I had just quit reading after? Since I couldn't identify an influential experience, I had to create my own. It was a Sunday and I browsed the library for a book, specifically the Knight Reads section. I settled upon <i>Elevation</i> by Stephen King, which was only 146 pages. It seemed like a good starting point because it was short and was from a well-known author. I have already started reading another book, <i>Fairy Tale</i> by Stephen King. I'm at 70/600 pages. I stuck with Stephen King because it is a safe choice, and I like stories with some fantasy.

            <h3>My Emotional Ties</h3>
            <p>
                I mainly enjoyed reading <i>Elevation</i> because it was the first time I had read a book in a long time. I had tried reading a different book a few months back, but I couldn't get into it. In comparison, I was able to read <i>Elevation</i> in one sitting. The emotional messages from the story are also valuable to me. The story follows Scott who has a strange medical condition: he is steadily losing weight without losing mass. He realizes that his weight is like a ticking clock, and eventually, he'll float away when he has zero weight. Despite the stressful situation, Scott makes the best out of his time. He makes friends with some neighbors, despite them having mutual hatred toward each other. Overall, the story is a lesson about how life is temporary, and it also shows that friendships can be made despite people having differences.

            <h3>Would I Recommend This Book?</h3>
            <p>
                I would recommend <i>Elevation</i> to people in the same situation as me: people who want a short book to get them back into reading. The message behind the story is inspiring. It makes me want to use my time more wisely, and also make more friendships. In terms of reading ease, this book was fit for my reading level. I would recommend it to readers who are around my age or older.
