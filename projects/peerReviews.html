            <h3>Multimedia Content Analysis #1</h3>
            <p>
                Your analysis was clear and I was able to easily understand the value behind veterans and their caregivers. I had previously never heard of veteran caregivers, and I did not realize there was a specific need for them. I now see that it is very important for disabled veterans to be cared for, as they have put work into our country. You also brought up ideas about power dynamics involving veterans. For example, how they can be looked down upon or outcast for their disabilities. If I had to give constructive criticism, I would say that the analysis could have been deeper. I liked looking at the "National Pride Score" chart that you included, and I think you could include more unique aspects like that. I admit this is more of a nitpick, and I can't think of a way I would make this more deep and interesting.
            </p>

                I agree that your chosen game Stratego has a similar power dynamic to capitalism. Even though both players start out with an equal amount of power, this fairness does not last long. Once one player becomes more powerful, it seems like they would be able to continuously use their power to become more powerful. I would say that this is a weakness of capitalism. I think that capitalism is good in a sense that it motivates people to work hard through competition. However, the system results in large power differences which are unfair towards people on the lower end. I think you went into a lot of depth about the power dynamics of Stratego and how it relates the the real world. The infographic was engaging and readable.

            <p>
                I have never heard of kairos before. Now that you have explained it, it seems like a very common rhetorical strategy used in advertisements. I often see time limits used in online shops to encourage users to spend money on a temporary sale. Grocery store weekly fliers are also an example because they reset every week. Customers may feel like they have to do a weekly shopping trip just to take advantage of the sales. In terms of the election, I see this strategy used a lot. I was asked to vote by a woman here on campus, and she tried to convey that the timeframe was short to register. I think you had good depth in your analysis, and you covered enough examples of the kairos rhetorical strategy. You covered the idea of power dynamics because kairos is a power dynamic. If I had to choose an area of improvement, I think the format of the document could have been more decorated.

                Hey Samuel, I think your use of vocabulary is great. You were able to answer the assigned questions very deeply. You talked about the "upbeat celebratory feel of the music" and the "violent imagery." I interpreted these as rhetorical strategies. You also talked about concepts of identity since you showed how this song exposes racism. I remember watching this music video when I was younger. I was too young to realize the references to racism, but now it is very clear to me. By having a music video, this song has an extra multimodal element in comparison to other songs. It makes the meaning easier to interpret. You also did a good job considering how this song can be interpreted differently by different groups of people. I like that all of your assignments are embedded directly in your portfolio so I can see them easily. There is one suggestion that comes to my mind: I see that you consistently choose the writing options for your Multimedia Content Analyses and your Creative Reflections. I think you should try out the other options because they can be more fun and it may be more interesting to the reader.

            <h3>Multimedia Content Analysis #5</h3>
            <p>
                Your analysis answers all of the required questions. I like that you included a quote and an image, making the project more multimodal. I think the document could be more decorated though. I think you could have added another image, such as a close up of the memorial. You did a good job talking about the rhetorical strategies of the memorial. You mentioned that there are no power dynamics involved, and I think that it is difficult to identify a power dynamic here. I think it could be argued that there exists a power dynamic between Lincoln and viewers of the memorial. People who view the memorial will feel like they have to respect it because Lincoln was once a very powerful person. Even though Lincoln does not exist today, his power still exists through the respect that people give to the memorial. I think the writing in your analysis is very clear and readable.

            <h3>Multimedia Content Analysis #6</h3>
            <p>
                Your chosen format does a good job at conveying the ideas of the analysis. The meme is centered and big enough so that I can easily see what I should look at first. I think you did a good job on your analysis by mentioning specific rhetorical strategies like pathos. I also like that you chose a relatable meme. It reminds me of when we have to throw the stuffed squirrel to decide who speaks in class. You included ideas about identity, since you explained that this meme was intended for younger audiences. I think one area of improvement could be the general organization of the analysis. Breaking the text down into smaller paragraphs with headings could help the reader to understand the content easier. Headings would also add to the decoration of the analysis. In response to your meme, I believe that we should embrace presenting in class, as well as answering questions. They can both be fun and they add to the social environment.

            <h3>Multimedia Content Analysis #7</h3>
            <p>
                You did a good job explaining why Jimmy Z is an important character. He appears to be very helpful to the other characters of the show. I often prefer to work alone, so I am not very similar to Jimmy Z. I like working alone because I will never run into issues when distributing the workload. The structure of your analysis is effective. I like how you integrated the images. If I had to make one suggestion, you could consider splitting your large paragraph into smaller sections with headings. This could make it easier for the reader to process the content. You hit all the key points of the analysis, including the character's identity, actions, and contextual variation. You also explained Jimmy's role very well by using real examples from the show, such as running the communications system. The image of him pointing to the tardigrade is a well-chosen image. It shows me that he is tech-savvy and is also teaching his teammates.
            </p>
            <h3>Multimedia Content Analysis #8</h3>
            <p>
                I like the organization of your analysis and your website. It is decorated well and looks clean. I like that you split your analysis into multiple sections, each having a heading. This makes it easier for me to understand what each section is about, rather than reading a wall of text. You used great vocabulary and I can also tell that you have watched the show. You included explanations for rhetoric and identity. I like how you described the colors of each. Even though they are just colors, you emotionally described them. If I had to give any constructive criticism, I would say that your analysis is a bit vague and general. You didn't mention any real-life equivalents of earth-bending. You could have used an example about, let's say, doing your homework. Your earth-bending traits may show up here by allowing you to work slowly but steadily for long periods. You could also relate this to exercise, as you may excel in longer aerobic exercises.

            <h3>Multimedia Content Analysis #9</h3>
            <p>
                Like you, I have also had a great interest in fantasy books. Most of my childhood books were fantasy, and I have recently gotten back into reading some more fantasy books. I like the genre because the possibilities are much less limited compared to realistic fiction. I have read a few of the first Harry Potter books and they were great. I think you did a good job of explaining why this book series was important to you. Maybe you could have included more interesting images, such as the cover of one of the books. You answered all the questions asked by the assignment. For example, you spoke about your age, emotional ties, and the book's target audience. I plan to keep reading more fantasy books and your analysis has helped me realize the value of the genre. Fantasy is fun to read, and it can even teach real-world lessons.
