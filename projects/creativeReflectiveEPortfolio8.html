            <h3>How I've changed</h3>
            <p>
                Since I have never watched <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, it has grabbed my interest.
                I don't watch many shows or movies because I am busy. If I try watching the show though,
                I could probably fit the time in. I could use some break time anyway. I am passionate about the air element and
                it suits me well. My peer review partner explained some details about the airbenders in the show,
                and it was helpful information.
            </p>

            <h3>My Next Best Choice</h3>
            <p>
                If I couldn't choose the air element, I would choose the earth element instead. This is because the earth element seems to be calm,
                and I am not an argumentative person. Earth is involved with slow but steady problem-solving. In school
                assignments, I can get caught up on small details for hours. Despite this, I end up creating high-quality work. This
                could be described as being a perfectionist.

            <h3>Choosing a Favorite Character</h3>
            <p>
                After reading through the descriptions of some characters, I settled upon Uncle Iroh as my favorite character.
                His appearance first caught my eye because he looked like an old friendly man. Because of his age, I inferred that he
                is intelligent. To draw a comparison, I also like the black cat from the movie <i>Coraline</i> for the same reason
                of being old and wise. I like that Uncle Iroh used to be part of the Fire Nation but separated once he realized that they
                were bad people.
