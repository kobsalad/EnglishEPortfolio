            <h3 style="margin-top: 0">By Jacob Lamp</h3>
            <p>
                As a former cashier and frequent food shopper, I have some experience with grocery store sales. I work at
                a grocery store called ShopRite, which is local to the Northeast where I am from. I will be explaining
                some strategies hidden within grocery store sales.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Judging by the Cover</h3>
            <p>
                You have probably been told the common phrase, "Don't judge a book by its cover," but that's exactly what
                you should do when reading a grocery store flyer. The best deals are likely to be placed on the front page
                in order to grab the attention of a customer. This is in the hopes that they will continue looking through
                the rest of the deals. Below is an example of the front page of the current Publix weekly flyer:
            </p>
            <img src="../images/multimediaContentAnalysis3/publixFrontPage.png" width="50%">
            <p>
                I notice that these front page items tend to have some variety, which helps to maximize the targeted audience
                of customers. They also seem to be items that are commonly purchased, and this helps to attract attention
                from the most common group of customers. In comparison to other grocery stores, the Publix weekly flyer is
                unique in terms of how the images of food are layed out. Some of the food is laid out in the form of a
                complete meal, with the names of items listed nearby. This goes against common design, and I believe this
                creativity may even be noticed by the customers.
            </p>
            <h3>2. It's Not All Sales</h3>
            <p>
                While the weekly fliers can contain some good prices, it's important to make your own judgement to determine
                which items are worth their price. Grocery stores can include items in these flyers that haven't actually been
                marked down. They hope that customers will subconsciously assume the prices in the flyer are all good deals.
                They can also change prices to create the illusion of a good price. I have noticed an example of this when one
                of my frequently purchased items increased in price for one week, but then went on sale the next week. This
                creates the illusion of a larger amount of savings. Here is an example below:
            </p>
            <img src="../images/multimediaContentAnalysis3/priceIncrease.png" width="30%">
            <h3>3. Jumping over Hurdles</h3>
            <p>
                From my time working as a cashier, I have noticed a potential business strategy at play behind the scenes.
                Imagine this: You are an elderly shopper who isn't familiar with technology. In the weekly flyer you see the
                following sale:
            </p>
            <img src="../images/multimediaContentAnalysis3/shopriteDigitalCoupon.png" width="30%">
            <p>
                You take four of these items and eventually go through checkout with a full order. After using your store
                card the items come out to be 4 for 5$, but it goes unnoticed. This is because the 4 for 4$ sale was
                actually a digital coupon, and you would have needed to claim it on the store app. I have seen this
                situation happen many times with digital coupons, and I suspect that coupon rules are made to be purposely
                confusing to prevent too many people from taking advantage of the sale. This is a power dynamic that
                involves grocery stores using confusion to their benefit. On a positive note, this should allow grocery
                stores to offer better sales, because the sales are being used by less people. Of course, this tactic is
                not used at all grocery stores. Aldi is a good example of a store that minimizes sale confusion, as they
                have no membership system. This means that sales are given to anybody.
