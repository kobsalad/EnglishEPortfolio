            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Mary Ellen Mark was a photographer interested in capturing photos of people who were far
                from normal society. This particular photo is one of multiple that she took of the
                homeless Damm family. The house shown in the image is one that they do not own, but
                instead are squatting in. Mark has written a much more extensive background of this
                photo on her <a href="https://www.maryellenmark.com/books/exposure/images/c6551441-0cd2-4c6b-b55b-fff06db73bea">website</a>, which I encourage you to read.

            <h3>Rhetorical Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                Now that we have established the context of this photo, it's time to get into the analysis.
                When looking at this photo, my eyes are most drawn to Crissy on the left of the bed. She
                is the only person awake in the photo, and her face is centered. One rhetorical strategy
                is the use of proportions and positioning of objects in a photo. Crissy's role as the main
                focus of the photo is enhanced by the fact that her face is centered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another rhetorical strategy is the use of facial expressions. In a photo, there is a limit
                to how much information can be conveyed. This is because photos mainly have a single mode
                of communication. They can be multimodal if there is text in the photo, or if the photo is
                converted into a physical material object. One useful way to convey a person's emotions is
                to capture their facial expression. Crissy has a blank stare which does not meet the camera.
                Her face seems to be emotionless, and it is as if she has gone numb to her horrible living
                conditions. It appears that she is in a state of acceptance, and she does not think her life
                can be changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pathos is one of the three common rhetorical strategies, and it is definitely used within
                this photo. The evoked emotion is one of disgust and pity: the nightstand is messy, there
                is trash on the floor, the drawers are broken, and the girl seems to be stuck in her
                father's arms. This photo made me hope for improvements within this family. I gained some
                hope when I read that the mother, Linda,
                took the kids and left. It seems that this was because of the abuse caused by the father,
                Dean. It is possible that conditions will improve for Linda and the children. I think
                it is also important to try to prevent these situations from happening in the first
                place. It is debatable whether or not these parents should have had children given that
                they were unfit to care for them.

            <h3>Identity and Power Dynamics</h3>
            <p>
                A power dynamic exists between Mark and the Damm family. Mark seems to be financially
                stable, and she lives as a part of society. The Damm family struggles financially, and
                they have many other troubles such as drug use and abuse. The family was in such a bad
                condition that they did not care anymore if the photos were taken of them. It is as if
                they just gave up and allowed someone of higher power to have their way. This photo is
                a challenge to societal norms because it exposes living conditions that are far from
                normal. It is easy to forget that these types of living conditions exist since we are
                not exposed to them very often.
            </p>
            <h3>Contextual Variation</h3>
            <p>
                I envision two different possible audiences for this photo. One of them is everyday
                people who have better living conditions. They will likely feel disgust and pity for
                the family. The second audience is other people who have similar living conditions to
                this family. They will be more understanding and also feel pitiful because they have
                personal experience.
