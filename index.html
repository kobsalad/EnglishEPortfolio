                <h4>Multimedia Content Analysis #1</h4>
                Your analysis was clear and I was able to easily understand the value behind veterans and their caregivers. I had previously never heard of veteran caregivers, and I did not realize there was a specific need for them. I now see that it is very important for disabled veterans to be cared for, as they have put work into our country. You also brought up ideas about power dynamics involving veterans. For example, how they can be looked down upon or outcast for their disabilities. If I had to give constructive criticism, I would say that the analysis could have been deeper. I liked looking at the "National Pride Score" chart that you included, and I think you could include more unique aspects like that. I admit this is more of a nitpick, and I can't think of a way I would make this more deep and interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Multimedia Content Analysis #2</h4>
                I agree that your chosen game Stratego has a similar power dynamic to capitalism. Even though both players start out with an equal amount of power, this fairness does not last long. Once one player becomes more powerful, it seems like they would be able to continuously use their power to become more powerful. I would say that this is a weakness of capitalism. I think that capitalism is good in a sense that it motivates people to work hard through competition. However, the system results in large power differences which are unfair towards people on the lower end. I think you went into a lot of depth about the power dynamics of Stratego and how it relates the the real world. The infographic was engaging and readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Multimedia Content Analysis #3</h4>
                I have never heard of kairos before. Now that you have explained it, it seems like a very common rhetorical strategy used in advertisements. I often see time limits used in online shops to encourage users to spend money on a temporary sale. Grocery store weekly fliers are also an example because they reset every week. Customers may feel like they have to do a weekly shopping trip just to take advantage of the sales. In terms of the election, I see this strategy used a lot. I was asked to vote by a woman here on campus, and she tried to convey that the timeframe was short to register. I think you had good depth in your analysis, and you covered enough examples of the kairos rhetorical strategy. You covered the idea of power dynamics because kairos is a power dynamic. If I had to choose an area of improvement, I think the format of the document could have been more decorated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Multimedia Content Analysis #4</h4>
                Hey Samuel, I think your use of vocabulary is great. You were able to answer the assigned questions very deeply. You talked about the "upbeat celebratory feel of the music" and the "violent imagery." I interpreted these as rhetorical strategies. You also talked about concepts of identity since you showed how this song exposes racism. I remember watching this music video when I was younger. I was too young to realize the references to racism, but now it is very clear to me. By having a music video, this song has an extra multimodal element in comparison to other songs. It makes the meaning easier to interpret. You also did a good job considering how this song can be interpreted differently by different groups of people. I like that all of your assignments are embedded directly in your portfolio so I can see them easily. There is one suggestion that comes to my mind: I see that you consistently choose the writing options for your Multimedia Content Analyses and your Creative Reflections. I think you should try out the other options because they can be more fun and it may be more interesting to the reader.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Multimedia Content Analysis #5</h4>
                Your analysis answers all of the required questions. I like that you included a quote and an image, making the project more multimodal. I think the document could be more decorated though. I think you could have added another image, such as a close up of the memorial. You did a good job talking about the rhetorical strategies of the memorial. You mentioned that there are no power dynamics involved, and I think that it is difficult to identify a power dynamic here. I think it could be argued that there exists a power dynamic between Lincoln and viewers of the memorial. People who view the memorial will feel like they have to respect it because Lincoln was once a very powerful person. Even though Lincoln does not exist today, his power still exists through the respect that people give to the memorial. I think the writing in your analysis is very clear and readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Multimedia Content Analysis #6</h4>
                Your chosen format does a good job at conveying the ideas of the analysis. The meme is centered and big enough so that I can easily see what I should look at first. I think you did a good job on your analysis by mentioning specific rhetorical strategies like pathos. I also like that you chose a relatable meme. It reminds me of when we have to throw the stuffed squirrel to decide who speaks in class. You included ideas about identity, since you explained that this meme was intended for younger audiences. I think one area of improvement could be the general organization of the analysis. Breaking the text down into smaller paragraphs with headings could help the reader to understand the content easier. Headings would also add to the decoration of the analysis. In response to your meme, I believe that we should embrace presenting in class, as well as answering questions. They can both be fun and they add to the social environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Multimedia Content Analysis #7</h4>
                You did a good job explaining why Jimmy Z is an important character. He appears to be very helpful to the other characters of the show. I often prefer to work alone, so I am not very similar to Jimmy Z. I like working alone because I will never run into issues when distributing the workload. The structure of your analysis is effective. I like how you integrated the images. If I had to make one suggestion, you could consider splitting your large paragraph into smaller sections with headings. This could make it easier for the reader to process the content. You hit all the key points of the analysis, including the character's identity, actions, and contextual variation. You also explained Jimmy's role very well by using real examples from the show, such as running the communications system. The image of him pointing to the tardigrade is a well-chosen image. It shows me that he is tech-savvy and is also teaching his teammates.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Multimedia Content Analysis #8</h4>
                I like the organization of your analysis and your website. It is decorated well and looks clean. I like that you split your analysis into multiple sections, each having a heading. This makes it easier for me to understand what each section is about, rather than reading a wall of text. You used great vocabulary and I can also tell that you have watched the show. You included explanations for rhetoric and identity. I like how you described the colors of each. Even though they are just colors, you emotionally described them. If I had to give any constructive criticism, I would say that your analysis is a bit vague and general. You didn't mention any real-life equivalents of earth-bending. You could have used an example about, let's say, doing your homework. Your earth-bending traits may show up here by allowing you to work slowly but steadily for long periods. You could also relate this to exercise, as you may excel in longer aerobic exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Multimedia Content Analysis #9</h4>
                Like you, I have also had a great interest in fantasy books. Most of my childhood books were fantasy, and I have recently gotten back into reading some more fantasy books. I like the genre because the possibilities are much less limited compared to realistic fiction. I have read a few of the first Harry Potter books and they were great. I think you did a good job of explaining why this book series was important to you. Maybe you could have included more interesting images, such as the cover of one of the books. You answered all the questions asked by the assignment. For example, you spoke about your age, emotional ties, and the book's target audience. I plan to keep reading more fantasy books and your analysis has helped me realize the value of the genre. Fantasy is fun to read, and it can even teach real-world lessons.

            <p>
                <b>What have any of the readings in this unit reminded you about from your past or present as a reader and writer?</b><br>
                These readings have reminded me that it is important to value creativity in writing. I have become so focused on making my writing "correct" that I have lost sight of the real purpose of writing.<br>
                <b>What is your relationship towards revision? How were you taught to revise, and do you like that approach?</b><br>
                I have always given little care towards revisions in my writing. I would usually write something and then briefly reread it to catch typos or small grammatical errors. Usually I would be excited to finish the assignment, so I would skip through the revision process. I do not know how to revise a document using a formal step by step process.
            </p>
            <h3>9/13/2024</h3>
            <p>
                <b>What is your personal definition of revision?</b><br>
                Revision is the process of improving a piece of work.<br>
                <b>What revision techniques do you want to implement within your own studies?</b><br>
                I would like to try out all of these methods. The most interesting method seems to be mind maps.
            </p>
            <h3>9/16/2024</h3>
            <p>
                <b>What shocked you about Should Writers Use They Own English? Were you accustomed to the author's literacy mannerisms, or ways of speaking?</b><br>
                I was a bit surprised by the the dialect of the author, since the word were not written in Standard American English. However, I was able to understand the reading fairly well. I have become more accustomed to different dialects after being exposed to the past content from this class.<br>
                I do not think I have ever used code meshing because I have always had a fairly standard idiolect.
            </p>
            <h3>9/18/2024</h3>
            <p>
                <b>What discourse communities are you a part of?</b><br>
                I am in a GroupMe chat for my running club. I am also in some class Discord servers. I use reddit a lot but only for reading.<br>
                In texting I tend to use all lowercase because it looks most simple, except for the word I which auto-corrects. If I use correct case it would look like I am trying too hard. I don't use many emojis or gifs. I text for purpose mostly rather than for emotion, so my texts are simple.
            </p>
            <h3>9/20/2024</h3>
            <p>
                I notice a large theme of creativity and individualism in all of our readings. They all encourage us to write in a way that is personal and uniquely chosen by us. The readings encourage us that all forms of writing have value.<br>
                I do not often look at the student learning outcomes. After reading over them, I think that I do engage with these concepts.<br>
                The debates have been fun. Maybe we can have a more structured debate.
            </p>
            <h3>9/23/2024</h3>
            <p>
                I focus most on the rhetorical concept of genre conventions. I do this in writing that is not in English class. For example, in my discrete structures class, I may need to write a proof and I will try to follow a very strict structure. In normal English class though there aren't as much restrictions.<br>
                I would like to focus more on the rhetorical concept of audience. I believe that the whole purpose of writing is for the audience, so it should be most important.
            </p>
            <h3>9/30/2024</h3>
            <p>
                I would rate myself a 7/10 for Major Assignment #1. I think I talked about a good variety of content, but it was a little all over the place. The visual presentation was pretty good looking. I did not really like how my tone of voice sounded, it was clear that I was reading from a script.<br>
                I would like to approach major assignment 2 by choosing a different structure, since a PowerPoint is not allowing me to feel very creative. I would like to speak without a script but it is difficult for me to think of words to say.
            </p>
            <h3>10/2/2024</h3>
            <p>
                When hearing African American Vernacular English for the first time, I perceived it as emotional. I did not really mind that the grammar was different from English grammar, and I was still able to understand it. I always questioned the double negative, but after reading, now I realize that it is actually intended for emphasis. I agree with the main idea of the reading. It makes a lot of sense that this type of English is just English with a different grammar structure. The most impactful part of the reading was realizing that this way of speaking was developed from actual African grammar rules. I had assumed that it had just evolved separately.<br>
                I do not agree with the title of this reading, and the author does not agree with the title either. It is meant to be an incorrect statement.
            </p>
            <h3>10/4/2024</h3>

                I would not personally wear this in my everyday life, but I think it can be fun to occasionally wear unique clothing. I have a pair of Boa jorts that I wear on special runs. If I wore this it would be to some special event like a Halloween party when I am with friends. This outfit shows that Harry Styles wants to stand out. The audience of this image is fans of Harry Styles.

                One of my Major Assignment #2 artifacts: A Reddit post by a man who is sharing his experience of a barefoot race that he has just completed.<br>
                - The language was interesting because he wrote in all capital letters to show his excitement about how great he felt.<br>
                - One of the included images is of him running. I see that he is running alongside people wearing shoes, and this is an interesting contrast.<br>
                - The context makes this photo even more amazing. This man has been posting about barefoot running since around 2017<br>
                - This reddit post is implicitly arguing that barefoot running is good. The tone of joy shows that barefoot running is a joyful experience. It also shows that barefoot runners can still run at fast paces, as this man has included his time, distance, and pace data.

                Exigency is why a topic matters. It involves the writer and reader. The writer should consider exigency to engage the reader.<br>
                - My artifacts were some reddit posts that were related to topics of my interest. They also shared ideas that were less common. This is an example of a radical interpretation of an idea as mentioned in the text.<br>
                - I am reframing an issue because I am just revealing research that already exists.

                - I feel comfortable with the remainder of the coursework for this class. I am used to the assignments and I have been keeping up with my portfolio so I can easily submit it at then end of the semester.<br>
                - I manage my physical health by running, biking, and occasionally going to the gym. I have ideas of how I would like to manage my mental health. I would like to get on a more consistent bed time. I also would like to eliminate scrolling through videos. I need to replace these activities with purposeful break times outside.
